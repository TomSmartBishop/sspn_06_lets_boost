# sspn_06_lets_boost

This is sample code for the 6th SSPN meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/sspn16/events/231003288/

This is just demo code showing how to use some of the boost libraries. 
 
#Build
 * Install Boost 1.61 (or newer)
 * Install Open_CL
 * clone the repro
 * open a console and create a sub directory 'build' and switch to that directory
 * Run the command 'cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"' and open the solution in VS2015 on Windows and 'cmake .. && make' on Linux
 
#Source
 * I added a bunch of comments to the source code, but I'm not sure if it understandable without hearing the explaination from the meetup
